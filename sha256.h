/*
 *  This program implements the Secure Hashing Algorithm SHA256 as
 *  described in FIPS PUB 180-3 published in October 2008, see
 *
 *  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-3/fips180-3_final.pdf
 *
 *  PLEASE NOTE: While I implemented the SHA256 algorithm as good as my
 *               abilities and understanding of the standard cited above
 *               allow I'm not claiming that it is error free. Thus if
 *               you intend to use it e.g. in cryptographic applications
 *               you must review and test it carefully yourself!
 *
 *  A lot of ideas came from the example implementation from RFC 3174
 *  by D. Eastlake, 3rd (Motorola) and P. Jones (Cisco Systems), see
 *  e.g.
 *
 *  http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3174.html
 *
 *  The part for dealing with 64-bit numbers on systems that lack such
 *  a type has directly been taken from code written by Paul Eggert,
 *  and which is part of the GNU Coreutils in the file 'lib/u64.h'
 *  and can be downloaded e.g. from
 *
 *  http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/
 *
 *  What of the rest may be new is
